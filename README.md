Conformance Self‐Validation Testing
Conformance self‐validation testing is a required step of the certification process.
Self‐validation results are submitted through the corresponding test tools must be confirmed by FIDO’s Certification Secretariat at least 14 days before attending an interoperability event to ensure that implementations are at least minimally compliant with the specifications.
Conformance testing is available for all FIDO protocols.
The test tools can be used as part of the development process to ensure that implementations are conformant with the specifications as they are being developed.
When an implementation is ready for the official test, simply select that the test being run is an official test and the results will be logged as part of the official records.
